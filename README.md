<h1 align="center">🤠 Hey! I'm Henry!</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a fullstack developer that specializes in using the PERN stack.

<p align="center"> 
😄 I'm currently in my last year at York University for Information Technology and I can't wait to get into the workforce. I've been coding for over 4 years and it is still what I love to do in my free time! Aside from coding, one of my favourite past-times is that I enjoy barking at other dogs. Just kidding, but if you want to get to know me, shoot me a message!
