ðŸ˜„ About me: I'm currently in my last year at York University for Information Technology. I've been coding for over 4 years and it is still one of my greatest passions! Aside from coding, one of my favourite past-times is that I enjoy barking at other dogs. Just kidding, but if you want to get to know me, shoot me a message!
